Binary Search

Efficient searching algorithm in an ordered collection.

x - element looking for
T - collection searching in
p - first element in the array
r - last element in the array

BINARY-SEARCH(x,T,p,r)
  low = p
  high = max(p,r+1)
  while low < high
    mid = floor[(low+high)/2]
    if x <= T[mid]
      high = mid
    else low = mid + 1
  return high
